description: 'We live and work being connected to networks of individuals and physical devises. This networked interaction allows to reap huge economic benefits and raises fundamental questions about why this technology works successfully and scales so well. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way to reason about the new social, economic and technological networks. The course will motivate the student through actual applications to enable both an overview of these systems and a fundamental understanding of the key ideas. It will introduce the various tools and modeling concepts from mathematics and economics that apply in each situation, targeting at a truly interdisciplinary learning experience.'
