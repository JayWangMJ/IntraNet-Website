description: 'Reading course where the professor will provide some initial material and students will choose which topics to develop further according to their interests. Students will present each week several papers.'

topics:
    - 'week  1: Introduction,  asymptotic complexity, divide-and-conquer, master theorem, peak finding'
    - 'week  2: D&C applications, quicksort, median, probabilistic algorithms, FFT'
    - 'week  3: Lower bounds, heaps, data structure challenges'
    - 'week  4: Binary search trees, AVL trees, interval trees, Van Emde Boas Trees'
    - 'week  5: Hashing I: hashing techniques, modular arithmetic and applications, amortization'
    - 'week  6: Hashing II: bloom filters, perfect hashing, balls and bins'
    - 'week  7: Graph searches: BFS, DFS, strongly connected components'
    - 'week  8: Shortest paths: Bellman Ford, Dijkstra, A*'
    - 'week  9: Greedy algorithms: MSTs, Huffman codes, etc'
    - 'week 10: Dynamic Programming I'
    - 'week 11: Dynamic Programming II, Network flows'
    - 'week 12: NP completeness'
    - 'week 13: Polynomial reductions'
    - 'week 14: Coping with NP-completeness: approximation algorithms, branch and bound, local search'
