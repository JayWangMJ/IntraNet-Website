Teaching Philosophy Highlights: It is centered along the three axis: (a) design a course that is intellectually challenging to students and stimulates their minds by understanding in depth the fundamental concepts and questions; (b) raise the level of capabilities of all students, not only of the gifted ones; (c) have the students enjoy the journey by being very clear and engaging in my presentation and making sure that the reading material is very informative to read and understand.
